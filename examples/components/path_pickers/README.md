# Path Pickers

You can use file pickers and folder pickers.  
Of course, you can drop files on the pickers to specify the paths.

        "button": "copy",
        "components": [
            {
                "type": "file",
                "id": "img",
                "label": "Image file you want to copy",
                "extension": "BMP and GIF files (*.bmp;*.gif)|*.bmp;*.gif|PNG files (*.png)|*.png",
                "add_quotes": true
            },
            {
                "type": "folder",
                "id": "out",
                "label": "Output path",
                "add_quotes": true
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Components

`components` is an array of GUI components (e.g., file pickers).
Each component should be defined as a dictionary.  

-   `type` is the component type. `file` for a file picker, and `folder` for a directory picker.
-   `label` is the string written above the text box of the picker.
-   `extension` is an option for file pickers. It specifies the wildcard for file extensions. Use the same syntax as for [wxWidget's wildcards](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/classwx_file_dialog.html).
-   `add_quotes` is an option for components. It adds quotes (`""`) to the input strings.

## Command

Tuw injects inputs of components into `command` when executing the command.
You can specify where they should be injected with `%*%`.
In the example, the file path will be injected at `%img%`, and the folder path will be at `%out%`.
