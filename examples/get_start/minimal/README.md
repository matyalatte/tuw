# Minimal GUI

Tuw reads `./gui_definition.json` (, `.jsonc`, or `.tuw`) when launching the executable. You can define a GUI in the JSON file.  
  
The following JSON is for a minimal GUI that you can create.
It has only a button to echo `Hello!`.  

![minimal](https://github.com/matyalatte/tuw/assets/69258547/a47047d4-0b7c-48cf-bf6b-18b62476e71c)

```json
{
    "gui": {
        "command": "echo Hello!",
        "components": []
    }
}
```

You can write a definition of your GUI in `"gui": {}`.  

-   `command` is the command you want to execute when clicking the execution button.
-   `components` is an array of GUI components (e.g., file pickers). `[]` means no components.
